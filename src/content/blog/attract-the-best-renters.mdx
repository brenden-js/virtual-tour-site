## Renters Crave Detailed Spatial Insight
When evaluating rental listings, spatial layout and room dimensions are top priorities for tenants. They need to envision furnishing and living in the space. However, traditional marketing materials like photos and descriptions rarely convey full spatial awareness. This leaves renters unsure if the property truly fits their needs.

## Matterport Delivers Immersive Digital Floorplans
Matterport 3D tours bridge this information gap with dollhouse and floorplan views. The dollhouse view shows the entire property layout from above, revealing room connections and adjacencies critical for space planning.

Floorplan view takes this a step further with measured room dimensions. Just like an architectural drawing, Matterport floorplans detail each room's precise size down to the inch.

## Empower Renters with Interactive Tools
With Matterport's dollhouse and floorplans, renters have interactive tools to evaluate spaces themselves. They can visualize room function and furniture arrangement. Draggable measurements allow custom distance comparisons between walls, doors and more.

Renters gain complete spatial confidence before ever touring in-person. For remote renters, Matterport may even eliminate the need to visit certain properties that clearly meet or fail to meet their layout needs.

## Stand Out with Innovative Listing Content
While most listings only include basic floorplans, Matterport brings these assets to life digitally. The combination of immersive 3D tours and interactive floorplans showcases your properties in a truly modern way.

Next-level spatial insight gives your rental listings a competitive advantage. Matterport floors plans attract qualified tenants who value transparency, accountability and confidence during their housing search.

## Conclusion: Spatial Transparency Drives Leasing Success
In an increasingly digital era, renters expect more than static photos of listings. Matterport dollhouse and floor plan views deliver the transparent spatial awareness renters need. Ultimately, showcasing property layouts and room dimensions builds trust and drives leasing success.
