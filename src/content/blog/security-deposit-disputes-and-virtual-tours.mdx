## The Problem: Security Deposit Disputes
Security deposits are a vital protection for landlords and property managers - but disputes over deposit refunds are far too common. When tenants move out, vague move-in checklists and poor photo documentation make it difficult to prove damages. This leads to accusations of unfair deposit withholding.

## The Solution: Matterport Digital Property Archives
Matterport virtual 3D tours provide a clear solution. With Matterport, entire properties can be digitally archived at move-in and move-out. The dollhouse view reveals overall property condition, while immersive walking tours capture every room up close. Appliances, fixtures, walls, floors and other surfaces are documented in detail.

## Objective Comparisons Resolve Disputes
This creates an objective standard for comparison. Deposit disputes no longer rely on fading memories or he said/she said arguments. Every wall scuff and carpet stain is recorded in Matterport's interactive 3D space.

Wireframe view makes it easy to measure dents and holes precisely. Before/after sliding images pinpoint any new damages. Matterport tours become powerful evidence in claims court, should disputes advance that far.


## Benefits for Landlords and Tenants
Having an undisputed record of property condition protects both landlord and tenant rights. Tenants can prove they left the unit in suitable shape. Landlords can back up reasonable charges for repairs and cleaning.

In today's competitive rental market, transparency and fairness build trust on both sides of the landlord-tenant relationship. Matterport eliminates ambiguity around damage liability. Renters gain confidence their deposit is secure, while property managers have recourse for unit restoration costs.

## Conclusion: Matterport Brings Accountability
Matterport brings accountability to the move-in and move-out process. Tours eliminate ambiguity around damage liability. Renters gain confidence their deposit is secure, while property managers have recourse for unit restoration costs. Protecting deposits means protecting tenant rights, landlord interests and property investments.
