For-Sale-By-Owner (FSBO) sellers have a remarkable opportunity to save on commissions by listing properties independently. However, they also face the challenge of showcasing homes effectively without realtor expertise. This is where Matterport 3D tours provide game-changing advantages.

## Save Time and Increase Convenience
Scheduling showings around an owner’s availability can be disruptive and time-consuming. Matterport eliminates this headache by enabling 24/7 virtual access. Prospective buyers can explore the property on their own time, at their convenience.

This allows FSBO sellers to focus their energy on negotiating and contracts, rather than touring logistics. Matterport maximizes productivity for FSBOs with packed schedules.

## Maintain Privacy and Control
Many homeowners feel uncomfortable having strangers tour their home. With Matterport, owners maintain privacy and control. Virtual tours allow screening buyers before approving in-person showings, weeding out non-serious prospects.

Owners can also limit access to certain parties. Matterport puts FSBO sellers in the driver’s seat, giving them authority over who views their home.

## Expand Your Reach and Pool of Buyers
Matterport tours enable FSBO properties to be marketed anywhere to expand reach. Local buyers can view the property regardless of location, and remote or relocating buyers can also inspect listings thoroughly online.

Widening the buyer pool boosts chances of securing an ideal buyer – one who needs less convincing because they already connected with the home through Matterport.

## Gather Valuable Feedback Before Listing
Before officially listing, Matterport tours allow FSBO sellers to get objective feedback from real estate contacts. They can provide tips on pricing, staging and repairs to maximize sales price and speed.

Early feedback helps FSBOs make adjustments to ensure their home puts its best foot forward before going to market. Savvy FSBOs use Matterport to gather insights pre-listing.

With Matterport virtual tours, FSBO sellers gain major advantages of convenience, control, exposure and preparation. By harnessing the power of 3D tours, FSBOs can showcase standout listings that attract serious buyers.
