## The Pandemic Sharply Increased Remote Rentals
The pandemic drastically changed traditional apartment viewing and leasing. With social distancing requirements and relocation risks, many renters now prefer to tour and apply for rentals completely remotely. They want to secure housing without needing to visit in person.

## Limitations of Photos and Videos
However, pictures and videos have limitations in enabling truly informed remote rental decisions. Photos only show fragmented glimpses rather than full spaces. Videos follow scripted paths, lacking interactivity. This leaves gaps in spatial awareness and condition clarity.

## Matterport Tours Provide Total Remote Access
Matterport 3D tours bridge this remote rental gap with immersive virtual walkthroughs. Renters guide themselves through true-to-life digital models on any device. They gain comprehensive spatial understanding and evaluate condition just as if viewing in person.

Interactive dollhouse maps and precise floorplans further enhance the experience. Renters have everything needed to determine if a property suits their needs, no physical visit required.

## Confidence for Sight-Unseen Applications and Leasing
With Matterport's unmatched virtual access, renters can now apply and sign leases 100% remotely. Matterport tours provide the familiarity and transparency needed to feel confident in a rental. Virtual 3D reduces risks for remote renters.

## More Efficient Leasing and Property Management
For property managers, Matterport unlocks major operational efficiencies. Reducing or eliminating in-person showings saves significant time while enabling anytime global property access. Combined with remote leasing, Matterport maximizes productivity.

## Conclusion: Matterport is the Future of Leasing
The pandemic proved that virtual tours and remote leasing are here to stay. Matterport 3D unlocks the next level of virtual access renters now expect. With immersive digital models, renters gain confidence for sight-unseen leasing, property managers optimize operations, and the rental process evolves for a digital-first world.
